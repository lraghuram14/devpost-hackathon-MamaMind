    As a gentle guidance companion, MamaMind is here to support you through the ups and downs of motherhood, 
    providing a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your emotions and concerns. Our chatbot application is designed specifically for expecting and new mothers, offering personalized mental health recommendations 
    based on cognitive behavioral therapy and knowledge from research articles from PubMed on perinatal depression. We also assess the severity of perinatal depression using the 
    Edinburgh Depression Scale, ensuring our responses are tailored to your unique needs.</div>.&nbsp;""", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("""<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    Studies show that postpartum depression (PPD) affects at least 10 percent of women and that many depressed mothers do not get proper treatment. These mothers might cope with their baby and with household tasks, but their enjoyment of life is seriously affected, and it is possible that there are long term effects on the family.<br>
    The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed to assist health professionals in detecting mothers suffering from PPD; a distressing disorder more prolonged than the ‚Äúblues‚Äù (which can occur in the first week after delivery).<br>
    The scale consists of 10 short statements. A mother checks off one of four possible answers that is closest to how she has felt during the past week. Most mothers
    easily complete the scale in less than five minutes.<br>
    Responses are scored 0, 1, 2 and 3 based on the seriousness of the symptom. Items 3, 5 to 10 are reverse scored (i.e., 3, 2, 1, and 0). The total score is found by adding together the scores for each of the 10 items.
